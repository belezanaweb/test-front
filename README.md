## To begin I install the initical packages that I think must be necessary to start de project

-React-router-dom ( to switch beteen the paths )
-Axios ( just to consume the endpoint )
-React-hook-fom ( just to prevent re-render the form multiples times)
-Upgrade react-scripts to run npm start

### Theme

-I prefer to map the colors and font project to maintain color consistency and font scale. But I discover that the Font Helvetica Neue is not free so I decided to pick a similar font from Google Fonts wich is Arimo, I download helvetica Neue to local project because I feel that the pixels was giving some diffences about spacing. Other thing is there is a product with a different description of what is drawn in the styleguide.

### To maintain the info accros components

To maintain the information between routes and components I preferred to use only the state of the react itself. I gave up the use of context because as the react documentation itself "Context is used mainly when some data needs to be accessed by many components at different levels." and I didn't particularly feel that need here.

### To run application

NPM START
