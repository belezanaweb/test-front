## To begin I install the initical packages that I think must be necessary to start de project

-React-router-dom ( to switch beteen the paths )
-Axios ( just to consume the endpoint )
-React-hook-fom ( just to prevent re-render the form multiples times)
-Upgrade react-scripts to run npm start

### Theme

-I prefer to map the colors and font project to maintain color consistency and font scale. But I discover that the Font Helvetica Neue is not free so I decided to pick a similar font from Google Fonts wich is Arimo.
